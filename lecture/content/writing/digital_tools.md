Productivity/Motivation:

    Ishouldbewriting

Revisions/Text-to-speech:

    Specifiy

Managing References/Citations:

There are plenty of digital tools to manage citations and references; every academic project you‚Äôre starting should have its own maintained project library. For more info on how to use citation software and manage your library, check out the chapter on Project design. Commonly, you‚Äôll be asked to follow a specific citation and referencing style, e.g., the American Psychological Association (APA) 7. th Ed.. Most citation software tools automatically style your in-line citations and references according to your needs.

To make sure you‚Äôre not accidentally copying others‚Äô work, you can use a plagiarism checker, such as Scribbr.


Beyond docs: Formatting, LaTEX, and Overleaf?

Sometimes, it becomes necessary to have complete control over the look of a document; sometimes, certain journals will ask to provide manuscripts via a .tex file.

Both involve knowledge of LaTeX (pronounced ‚ÄúLah-tech‚Äù).

LaTeX is a powerful and flexible typesetting language that allows users to have complete control over the format of a document. Unlike traditional word processors, which can often be limiting in terms of formatting options, LaTeX provides the ability to create beautiful and professional-looking documents with ease. This is particularly useful for academic papers, where formatting requirements can be strict and complex. However, LaTeX is not just limited to academic papers; it can also be used to create CVs, resumes, and other types of documents.

LaTeX is, at times, still the preferred tool for many publishers and academic institutions. Additionally, because LaTeX allows for such fine-grained control over formatting, it can help to ensure that papers meet specific style requirements for different publications.

However, learning LaTeX from the ground up can be time-consuming and challenging, which is why platforms like Overleaf are becoming increasingly popular.
Overleaf

Overleaf is a powerful collaborative platform designed to simplify the process of creating and sharing academic documents. It offers a range of tools and features that make it easy for individuals and teams to write, edit, and collaborate on documents in real time. With Overleaf, you can focus on the content of your document while the platform takes care of formatting and layout.

One of the main benefits of Overleaf is its ability to streamline the writing process, allowing you to work more efficiently and effectively. The platform offers a wide range of templates and tools that help you create high-quality documents quickly and easily. There are templates available for a wide range of document types, including academic papers, CVs, and resumes, as well as a variety of styles and formats to choose from.

Additionally, Overleaf provides a range of collaboration tools that allow users to work together on a document in real-time, making it easy to share feedback and ideas and provides a secure and reliable platform for sharing and publishing your work. With built-in version control and easy integration with a range of popular publishing platforms, you can be confident that your work is safe and accessible to others.

In summary, Overleaf is an excellent platform for academics and researchers looking to streamline their writing process, collaborate with others, and share their work with a wider audience.
Working with Overleaf

To get started with Overleaf, it‚Äôs best to find a template via the template library.

Pick a field, follow a specific template, and click on the open as template button.

This will open the template as an editable document. You‚Äôll see the rendered or ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù version of the document on the right-hand side; this is how your final pdf would look like. On the left-hand side, you see a view of all the files that would make up the final document; simply click on them to show their content. Some templates, like the one depicted here, already come with user guides that you can simply follow to adapt a template to your needs.

The main content of a document on Overleaf is contained in .tex files. These LaTeX files contain both the text content you‚Äôll see in the rendered view and the LaTeX code specifying how the text should be displayed. LaTex code will be displayed in green, and the text it modifies is included in curly braces {} behind. For example, the \section{Introduction} declares that we‚Äôd like to start a new section with the title "Introduction".

In most cases, it will only be necessary to change the actual text components of a template. Simply change some of the content and click the green recompile button to preview your changes. If you‚Äôre done modifying a template, simply use the download button right next to the recompile button to export your document as a PDF file.

Overleaf provides further functionalities such as version history, allowing you to revert to an earlier version of the document, for example. You can also invite others to collaborate or chat about a document via the share option.
