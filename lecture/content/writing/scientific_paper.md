# Writing a scientific paper

Writing a scientific paper can be a challenging task, but with a well-structured approach and a few helpful tips, it can be a rewarding experience. 

A scientific paper is a **formal way** to communicate your research findings to the scientific community and is an essential part of the scientific process.


## Structure of a scientific paper

The following is a typical structure for a scientific paper:

### 1. Abstract:

- A **summary** of the hypothesis, design, and findings
- The PR section **(~200 words)**

### 2. Introduction:

- Establish a **state of knowledge**
- summarize **previous findings**
- bridge the **gap** between existing knowledge and current questions
- state the **research question** clearly and explain why it is important
- clearly state any **specific hypothesis**

### 3. Methods:

- Describe the **methods** and **procedures** used in the experiment, including any *equipment* and *materials* used
    - E.g., recruitment, inclusion/exclusion criteria, measures, hardware, procedure, design, analysis pipeline
- be detailed enough that someone else could **reproduce the experiment**

### 4. Results:

- Present your findings, including any **data** and **statistical analyses**
    1. **descriptives**
    2. **inferential statistics**
- Include **tables**, **figures**, and **graphs** to help illustrate the results

### 5. Discussion:

- Summarize the **main findings** and their significance
- **Verdict on the hypothesis**
- **Interpret** the results
- **discuss their implications** in the context of previous research
- **study limitations**
  - validity, measurement error, design weaknesses
- **recommendations** and **avenues for future research**

### 6. References:

- List the **sources cited** in the paper in a **consistent format** (e.g., APA, MLA).

```{dropdown} Tips for Junior Scientists üíÅ
 - Be **concise** and **to the point**
 - Avoid **unnecessary words/phrases**
 - Use **clear** and **simple language**
 - Avoid **technical phrases** unless necessary
 - Be **thorough** and **accurate** in reporting your results
 - Include **all relevant data** and **any limitations** (it is better to cut later than to have to redo the work because you missed important implications)
 - Support your claims and conclusions with **references as much as possible**
    - if you state a fact, you gotta have the receipts
 - **Review** and **revise** your work several times before submitting it
 - Pay attention to **grammar**, **spelling**, and **formatting**.
```

## 10 rules on structuring your paper

Writing a good paper takes time and practice. We'll summarize the most important points of a paper by **[Mensh & Kording (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)** providing **rules for scientific writing**. 

These rules aim to introduce a frame of reference on how to get started with scientific writing, continuously improve, and avoid mistakes and frustrations.

We'll go over 
- **general principles regarding writing for an audience (rules 1 - 4)**
- the **different components of a paper** and what they are each trying to communicate **(rules 5 - 8)**
- some considerations for the **writing process itself (rules 9 - 10)**

You can also find a checklist for your scientific writing based on **[Mensh & Kording (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)** here.

### Principles (Rules 1‚Äì4)

In the following section, we'll introduce **general writing principles** to **optimize the reader‚Äôs experience** and **effectively communicate the aims of our work**.

#### 1. Focus your paper on a central contribution, which you communicate in the title

- A paper ideally aims to provide a **single contribution**
   - multiple contributions: tend to be less convincing and, therefore, **less memorable**
- The **title** is a crucial part here
    - the first element a reader encounters
    - determines if people will read even the abstract <br>
‚ùó **Focus on a single message transmitted by the title**, but don't over-sell

> **Examples**

> ‚úñÔ∏è Mindfulness Eliminates Academic Stress and Boosts Performance Across All Students

#### 2. Write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know your work

You, as the writer, will be the expert on your work, but we'll have to assume that readers may possibly be naive to the work or field. <br>
Therefore, we need to consider the following:

- **quality** and how **clear** your writing is can be nearly impossible to judge work from the perspective of the naive reader

- an approach from the perspective of a naive reader means to make clear
  1. **why do you need to understand/care about this problem**
  2. **how the paper answers the problem/question** (ideally understandable with minimal effort)

- **define technical terms** and **avoid abbreviations/acronyms** 
    - adapt to the working memory constraints of humans
        - 2-3 abbreviations in total, write out the first time with the abbreviation in **()**
    - **avoid using different words for the same concept/thing** :arrow_right: confuses the reader

#### 3. Stick to the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme

Scientific papers benefit from being written in a classical story structure with a discernible beginning, a well-defined body, and a conclusive end. Therefore, we make use of the **context-content-conclusion (C-C-C)** scheme.

The C-C-C scheme defines the structure of the paper on multiple scales:

1. for the *whole paper*:
- introduction = **context**
- methods/results = body/**content**
- discussion =  **conclusion**

2. for *each paragraph*:
- first sentence = defines the topic or **context**
- body = novel **content** put forth for the reader‚Äôs consideration
- last sentence = provides the **conclusion** to be remembered

The C-C-C scheme produces texts aimed at more patient readers who take their time to engage and interact with a text.

```{dropdown} Know your audience! ‚òùÔ∏è
It's best to generally avoid writing for impatient readers. We'll have to rely on the title and abstract for this, but these can be caught by presenting the most exciting content first while necessarily following up with important context to remain credible.
```

#### 4. Optimize your logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism

Avoid zig-zag through your story:

- only the **central idea should be touched upon multiple times**
- **minimize** the number of **subject changes**
- **string related paragraphs together** without interruptions by unrelated materials

Instead, make use of **parallelism** to provide structure:

- parallel messages ‚û°Ô∏è parallel form ‚û°Ô∏è easier for reader
- communicate **different points of an overarching topic using the same syntax**

```{card}
‚úÖ **Parallelism**
^^^
 Introduction: 

 - Hypothesis 1
 - Hypothesis 2
 - Hypothesis 3

 Methods:

 Analysis 1 ‚û°Ô∏è Hypothesis 1
 Analysis 2 ‚û°Ô∏è Hypothesis 2
 Analysis 3 ‚û°Ô∏è Hypothesis 3

 Conclusion:

 conclusion 1 ‚û°Ô∏è Hypothesis 1
 conclusion 2 ‚û°Ô∏è Hypothesis 2
 conclusion 3 ‚û°Ô∏è Hypothesis 3
```        

### The components of a paper (Rules 5‚Äì8)

Components (abstract, introduction, etc.) have different objectives; therefore, the specifics of their **C-C-C structure** necessarily differ. The following will discuss the specifics of these differences.

#### 5. Tell a complete story in the abstract

Quite often, the abstract is the **only part that will be read**; therefore, it must **efficiently convey the entire message of the paper**.

The **C-C-C-scheme** is again highly conserved in the abstract

- **context** = First sentence:
    - introducing the **broader field** and the **specific research question of study** 
    - distinguish given paper from current state-of-the-art ‚û°Ô∏è the **specific gap**
    - why does it matter ‚û°Ô∏è **connection between the specific gap and the broader context**

- **content**: 
    - describe the **method/approach** used to fill the gap 
    - executive **summary of results**

- **conclusion** = Last sentence
    - interpret results to **answer question(s) posed in context**
    - how do results **impact the broader field** ‚û°Ô∏è ‚Äúbroader significance‚Äù
    
    

#### 6. Communicate why the paper matters in the introduction

This section flows **from a broad introduction to the specific problem(s)**, highlighting a **gap in knowledge/methods** and **why this gap is important**, to progressively more specific paragraphs to **reach a clear exposition of what is missing** and, in subsequent paragraphs, how the paper aims to address the problem.

Work from a

1. field gap: e.g., language processing
2. subfield gap: speech processing
3. gap within the subfield that you will fill: influence of speech rhythm on neural rhythms

Each introduction paragraph should further **develop the gap from context to content to conclusion**.

- **context** = orient the reader
- **content** = outline the ‚Äúknowns‚Äù 
- **conclusion** = critical ‚Äúunknown‚Äù

Further, make sure to include **clues related to the gaps** that lead into or **prime reader for your hypothesis and method sections**.

#### 7. Deliver the results as a sequence of statements, supported by figures, that connect logically to support the central contribution

Aim to convince the reader that the **claims in the abstract and the following conclusion are supported by data and logic**.

The first paragraph 

- **summarizes the overall approach** used to address the problem outlined in the introduction
- sketches out the **logical structure** of how the results support the claims.

Ideally, these are converted into a **sequence of declarative statements** on the highlighted gap in knowledge/methods and why the researchers are addressing them in a clear progression of logical steps. These **statements** can then be used as the **names of the headers of subsections** and **titles of figures** in the following paragraphs.

All subsequent paragraphs should follow the structure of:

- **context**: setup the *questions* that the paragraph answers
- **content**: *data/logic*
- **conclusion**: *answer* the question

In this section, **figures, tables, and titles** are particularly important, as these are the most ‚Äúobjective support‚Äù towards claims. 

They should be **highlighted** as such and be **clear, concise, and readable**.

#### 8. Discuss how the gap was filled, the limitations of the interpretation, and the relevance to the field

The discussion aims to explain how the **results have filled the gap identified in the introduction**, provide **caveats to our interpretations**, and **describe how the findings advance the field**. 

Overall, provide a **step-by-step outline to put the conclusions of the paper into context**.

The structure should roughly as following:

First paragraph:

- general **summary of findings** (from results section)

Second to penultimate paragraph:

- describe the **area of weakness or strength** linking to **relevant literature**
- perceive **contributions/discuss future directions** to extend it
- how can **literature alleviate concerns or future experiments address them**

Last paragraph:

 - description of **how paper moves field forwards**

### Process (Rules 9 and 10)

Let's introduce some helpful processes and habits to **maximize impact** and **minimize investing time into less important aspects of the writing process**.

#### 9. Allocate time where it matters: Title, abstract, figures, and outlining

It's paramount to emphasize the **central logic** that underlies the scientific claim, the **main message** of the paper. Reflections on the logic behind the paper connect the experimental phase with the paper-writing phase.

You should aim to:

- allocate time based on presumptive importance

    - **title, abstract, figures** vs. rest/methods (not ideal but unfortunately the default for most readers)

Plan before producing

- make an **outline**
  - informal sentence for each planned paragraph
- (potentially) start the process around the description of each result
- each paragraph has a defined role ideally defined at the outline stage

Figures and tables take time to be designed and implemented well.

So before investing time, consider the following:

```{card}
**Figures** üì∂
^^^
- Is the figure **necessary**?
- Is the figure **simple, clean, and free of extraneous detail**?
- Is the data **plotted accurately**?
- Are all **axes named correctly**?
- Are parallel figures or equally important figures prepared according to the same scale?
- Are all abbreviations and special symbols explained?
- Is the figure **referred to in the text**?
```

```{card}
**Tables** üî†
^^^
- Is the table **necessary**?
- Is the entire table **single- or double-spaced** (including the title, headings, and notes)?
- Is the **title brief but explanatory**?
- Does every column have a **column heading**?
- Are all **abbreviations** and **special symbols explained**?
- Is the table **referred to in the text**?
```

#### 10. Get feedback to reduce, reuse, and recycle the story

Writing can be seen as an **optimization problem**, meaning, quite often, multiple iterations are necessary. 

> **Tip** üí°
>
> Accept that this is ok and usually what we want as:
>
> - some or all aspects can be **continuously improved**
> - **rewriting is often faster** than cumbersome editing

It's important to always check if further work is necessary to find violations of good writing; 
If some of the points below are true for your paper, just go back to the linked rules to improve your paper (the checklist is based on the paper by [Mensh & Kording](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)).

Writing is further not something that is done in isolation; it is essential to **ask for input/feedback from multiple people**:

- different test readers (differing in expertise etc.)
- reviewers (i.e., your P.I., etc.)
